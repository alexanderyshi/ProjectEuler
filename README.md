# ProjectEuler
My solutions and build script for Project Euler questions. 

There is nothing fancy in here, but I fancy my code-completing script convenient.
Load this anywhere into Bash for Windows and install g++ before using run.sh.
run.sh takes a single input, that being the question number that you would like to be run after compiling. If no input is provided, it will run the default problem number stored in the source
